Hi,

This is my first time trying out vim touch typing.

It seems good so far and I can use it with ease.

I will have to leave Oracle.

People judge me on it.

People judge oracle so hard.

People absolutely hate it.

I can't change that.

If they hate it then they will keep on change it.

The thing is do I want to stay on this dying company.

Using github as my diary!!

That seems aweful.

Real aweful.

I wish I could use joplin but I have never been sure about it.

I know for sure that I would like to use MarkDown.

Plus Dark Mode. Plus I get to learn vim.

Hmm..

I think I can use this along with todoist and then I am done.

Like if there is anything to attach I can do it using git folders.

Why not!!

Just make a new folder..

Add a principles folder and review it.

Add a todoist folder and review it.

You can make this for everyday.

You can create a cli to do this.

Just create a tool to add images.

Add a function to create the folder.

I want to take some modafinil right now.

I want to zoom it in right now.

Okay . Here it is I ma finally ingesting the miracle drug called modafinil.

I have yet to take my anti-depressants but writing seems to have taken my mind off that.

Overall I am planning to write a lot more.

Write a lot more than I possibly can.

And fix my life.

Time to mature out I guess. Everyone has to go throught this.

I am making big deal of myself.

I am just a ppup up on this planet. And I have gotta take my problems less seriously.

Yes. I have to take my problems a little shallowly.

I am focusing too much on my own self. My own pityness.

Oh I have drowned on my own pityness for so long.

I have beeninvloved in my own bullshit for so long that I have forgotten myself.

I have become too identified with my own mind.

I have become too identified with my own body.

I have become identified with things that can entangle me.

At the end of the day, is it worth it though?

No.

These are the causes of my suffering.

I wish for these suffering to disappear. And then I am able to break this stupid cycle of birth and death..

I have been sufferable for so long.

Let's just stop it okay. And now I have finally consumed the golden stuff.

The golden stuff was the modafinil all along.

I have to be really careful with it though.

It can also cause my productivity to decrease.

Let my brain drown on the positivity.

I finally got my hair cut. My nails are cut. Though there are other tasks that need to be completed.

I have yet to figure out my clothes.

REALLY!!

CLOPTHES!!1

My body care routine is not even fixed.

I don't even brush everyday. Much less floss.

My body aches everywhere especially my penis head. my wisdom teeth is painful.

My fat is growing. I can't even tell the amounts of food that I have been eating lately. It's in huge quantitiy.

I am not sure what to do with my life.

The headset thing is nice.

Wait what I am typing/

I just want my keyboard to arrive. Maybe that will save me.

Help me capitalism. If you cause pain to me then what are you useful for..

right>..

I have yet to figure out how capitalism works then.

Why I am so insufferable!! Oh why lord.
--

The penis pain is real I don't even know what to do about it.

The actual head pains a lot on very slight touches. It has been 4 months now. It should be cured already.

And my mind is obsessed with Cigs that's the only thing I can think about right now.

Cigs. It will solve everything.

Instead of working on myself.

I just wanna smoke.

That has become my one and only salvation.

I purchased a lot of chewing gums but they were no match for cigs.

How do I stop smokign...

I have no clue..

I have to fix my life.

I want to fix everything right now.

My posture.

My chair height.

A lot of things require fixing.

This is the best time to do it since I am on Modafinil.

Modafinil is by no way a miracle drug but it can cure my focus thing.

And that's my diary. All about complaints.

Will I ever find love.

Love is something that I have not even thought about.

I am so absorbed in myself.

It's all me me me me me ..

meme..

I have become a meme.

That's sad.
