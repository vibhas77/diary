Hi,

This is my first time trying out vim touch typing.

It seems good so far and I can use it with ease.

I will have to leave Oracle.

People judge me on it.

People judge oracle so hard.

People absolutely hate it.

I can't change that.

If they hate it then they will keep on change it.

The thing is do I want to stay on this dying company.

Using github as my diary!!

That seems aweful.

Real aweful.

I wish I could use joplin but I have never been sure about it.

I know for sure that I would like to use MarkDown.

Plus Dark Mode. Plus I get to learn vim.

Hmm..

I think I can use this along with todoist and then I am done.

Like if there is anything to attach I can do it using git folders.

Why not!!

Just make a new folder..

Add a principles folder and review it.

Add a todoist folder and review it.

You can make this for everyday.

You can create a cli to do this.

Just create a tool to add images.

Add a function to create the folder.

I want to take some modafinil right now.

I want to zoom it in right now.
