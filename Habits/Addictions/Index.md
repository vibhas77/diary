I am an addicted individual.

I am addicted to smoking.

I am addicted to hentai, porn, masturbation

I am addicted to them and I wanted to store my journey somewhere..

It's really difficult to deal with the bad ones.

These are real bad ones.

They are in no way a positive for me at all.

And it's not in the same level as other bad habits such as
drinking less water or not sleeping early,

It's bad to the point that I have been fighting them for years.

IT's bad to my core.

I wake up with these addictions and sleep with them.

These have been with me for a long time now.

I don't even wanna smoke anymore.

I don't even wanna masturbate anymore.

Yet I can't get rid of them easily.

I will fight them as long as I have to and never let them take charge
of me fully.

Today , I just wanna write so I will.

Well to begin with I am not even sure where it all started.

It started in college.

But how is unclear.

I remember smoking behind the 400 series and thinking to myself that this
smoking should never become a habit. Yet here I am.

I well knew that this was addicting before going into it.

Unlike porn.

I never knew porn was harmful.

But I knew smokign was harmful.

I have no control over my smoking habit.

The smoke free app did it for me for 2 months.

But I have not dared to reset it yet.

Okay. So the index page should have a tracker.

Of the last time that the deed was done.
